            <p>In recent decades, design has faced great challenges and profound transformations. Its traditional
              approach to crafting and shaping the tangible world has been revolutionized by the way this
              very world has changed, becoming infused with digital technologies that have made it smarter, more
              interactive, and more connected.</p>
            <p>Recent technological developments have generated even more rapid and extreme changes. The emergence of
              AI, machine learning, flexible electronics, miniaturized and implantable sensors, and hybrid synthetic-
              biological materials have not only provided designers with new design ingredients, but also generated
              new cultural and social landscapes in which they must design.</p>
            <p>This edition of the DeSForM conference will explore the implications of these recent and emerging
              technological transformations in the practice of design, with a particular focus on the aesthetics and
              human experience of these new systems.</p>
            <p>Designing beyond intelligence means that the design of such advanced and smart ecosystems should consider
              issues beyond mere algorithmic thinking and functionality. Scholars in the design field should start reflecting
              on the connections and mutual relations between the performance of these intelligent ecosystems and their
              physical appearances, aesthetics, interaction modalities, and personalities. In doing so, they will be able to
              address the design of ecosystemic user experiences.</p>

        <div class="subtitle">Designing for connected and expressive artificial ecosystems</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>DeSForM has traditionally dealt with the design of new, dynamic and interactive artifacts supported by the
            rise of intelligent systems (sensors, processors, algorithms, actuators, smart materials, etc.). Such
            systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, giving birth to new forms of digital-physical
            hybridizations, i.e. dynamic ecosystems where advanced materials, sensing technologies, artificial intelligences,
            data, and humans are deeply interconnected and mutually shaped. These emerging hybrid ecosystems have
            already reached a point where their understanding, design, and evaluation ask for the development of new
            approaches and tools, as the experiences they create are far more complex to foresee and assess.</p>
          <p>In this edition, we challenge scholars in this field to start thinking beyond designing for and with
            intelligence embedded into single artifacts, to broaden their focus and start addressing designing for
            distributed, hyperconnected, and complex intelligent ecosystems, and how their meaning, experience, and
            ethics can be approached in this new landscape.</p>
          <p>This evolving context of design calls for new design skills and ways of thinking that go beyond the
            traditional field of design, as well as the creation of multi-disciplinary and adaptable teams able to
            envision new interactive, interconnected and even unpredictable systems.</p>
          <p>The emergence of AI, robotic solutions, and big data connected with the spaces, objects and people we
            interact with everyday, will create new landscapes for future generations of designers. This will require
            designers to adopt new lenses in the design and evaluation of emerging technology, and it will necessitate
            that designers equip themselves with new ethical paradigms.</p>
          <p>This conference will face the need to explore new frontiers for design, where emerging forms of
            distributed intelligence become design material. This material should be fully investigated in terms of tangible
            manifestations, implications and impact on the design process, user experience, and social consequences.
            The conference will be structured around four main topics: Experiencing Complexity, Interacting with New
            Intelligences, Societal Impacts & Design Ethics, and Future Roles of Designers.</p>

        In 2005 DeSForM was born in (Eindhoven) the Netherlands with the premise of creating meaning through objects,
        interactions and people.
      </div>
      <div class="about-copy top">
        Over the years, the DeSForM community has explored and designed objects through a multisensorial approach
        always aiming at enriching users’ experiences with them. Throughout previous editions we have seen the
        development from digital and mechanical objects that had enriched sensorial presence to adaptive and
        intelligent objects that feel almost analogous to reality given their increased information processing power
        and sensory resolution. These are thanks to the recent developments in the material sciences, robotics,
        information and sensor technology, and improved production techniques. Consequently, the arena that belongs to
        design researchers and practitioners has gotten more sophisticated by being more technical, but also raises new
        questions regarding the effect and the impact of the new technologically rich designs. In 2017, DeSForM is
        returning to its place of birth opening up to a broader audience with deeper insights to debate about the
        future of dynamic “form” giving and its effects on people and their environment. The conference will be hosted
        by the industrial design schools of TU Delft and TU Eindhoven.

          Conference ambitions
        </div>
        DeSForM is an intimate, single-track conference that brings together design researchers, practitioners,
        students, and companies to have in-depth discussions over ongoing projects. It is an excellent platform for
        making new connections and bridging research interests. Therefore, we warmly invite multidisciplinary
        perspectives and discussions on current issues addressed in design research. Join us in Delft and Eindhoven and
        experience the rich and extensive design research and practice tradition that skillfully combines social
        sciences, arts and engineering to stimulate design-driven innovations!

          <p>At MIT, the Design Laboratory exists within a context of broad-based technological innovation and builds
            upon the unique advantages offered by this setting. It pursues research, executes practical design and art
            projects, and engages in scholarship and criticism. The Laboratory is organized as a collection of
            multidisciplinary research and project teams unconstrained by the traditional boundaries between the
            design, planning, and engineering professions and disciplines.</p>
          <p>The Design Lab, previously part of School of Architecture and Planning, is today within Comparative Media
            Studies and Writing (CMS/W) Department of School of Humanities and Social Sciences at MIT.</p>

          <p>
            DeSForM seeks to present current research into the nature, character and behavior of emerging typologies
            of connected and intelligent objects within adaptive systems. It aims to bring together researchers in the
            many related fields of design to assess the outcomes of this research and begin to identify issues and
            territories for future investigation and exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our original working premise for this research was that forms, either concrete or abstract, always carry or
            mediate meanings. It is the responsibility of designers to make good use of these meanings, for example, to
            make products beautiful, to stress the importance of certain values, or to improve a product’s ease of use.
            Further, it should promote or negotiate enriched experiences between people and people, people and objects,
            and in time between objects (systems of objects) and objects. Design uses its own languages for this
            purpose, just as poets, painters, journalists, sculptures, filmmakers and other artists do. The role of
            multi-sensory perception should also be explored as a channel to convey meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that our current conceptions of objects, things and artifacts need to be shattered once and for
            all so that we can be truly creative in how we contribute to the conceiving of the “new things.” This
            becomes even more important as emerging technologies and new forms of intelligence enrich and transform the
            nature of traditional objects and artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            DeSForM does this by inviting creative people from very different practicing contexts and representing
            somewhat different aspects of the design disciplinary spectrum. If we succeed in accumulating the views and
            the abilities each brings in the conceiving of ideas and things, then surely the results would be very,
            very different, and might even be important in driving the practice and discipline of Design forward in
            some way.
